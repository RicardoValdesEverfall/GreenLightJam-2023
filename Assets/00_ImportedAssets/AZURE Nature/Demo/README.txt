Before you open the demo scene, follow these steps:

Built-in RP:
1) Set the color space to Linear (Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Linear)
2) Install the Post-Processing package from Package Manager

URP:
1) Set the color space to Linear (Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Linear)
2) Import "URP (2019.4-2021.1)" or "URP (2021.2+)" package depending on your Unity version (AZURE Nature > SRP Packages)
3) Set render pipeline asset (Edit > Project Settings > Graphics)

If you need to return to the standard pipeline, just import "Built-in" package from "SRP Packages" and remove render pipeline asset from the graphics tab.
